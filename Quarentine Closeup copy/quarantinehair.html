          <p>This is my dog Princess. She always gets treated like a princess and gets spoiled all the time with expensive treats, multiple collars, and really nice haircuts.
            However, during quarantine, the place she goes to get her hair cut had to close so her hair grew out for a long time. This picture is from the beginning of May and she looked
           like a mess!</p>
