          <p>This photo is from March when everyone went home for spring break, and then two weeks later, we all had to move out of our dorms for the rest
             of the semester. Because of how sudden this was, I remember how much work this was and I hated having to do school from home. It took a long
           time for me to adjust, but by now, I have gotten very used to doing online classes and sometimes enjoy them a lot!</p>
