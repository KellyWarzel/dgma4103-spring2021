        <section style="width:50%;">
          <p>When quarantine started, many restaurants where closed or open only during certain times. As you can see from this picture, my mom has a very
             big obsession with Starbucks. Around the time of March and April, the only Starbucks that was open was about 40 minutes away from my house.
              To help my moms addiction, she would go out once a week and get a very large amount of her favorite drink to last her the rest of the week
               until she runs out and needs to stockpile more. This was definetly something that kept quarantine interesting, because no one held back
             from laughing at her for this, not even herself!</p>
