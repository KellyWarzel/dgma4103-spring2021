          <p>My name is Kelly Warzel and I am in my second year here at Alfred State. I major in Digital Media and Animation and have a huge passion for art.
          I have always been into painting, drawing, coloring, digital art, and pretty much anything someone might consider "crafty". I have many interests and hobbies,
        but you might realize that most of them are all art related. My hobbies include crochetting, painting, making custom stickers, diamond painting, and a lot more
      that I just might not do that often.</p>

          <p>What inspired me to go into the major I am in is my love for Disney and Pixar. I am into tons of different types of movies and franchizes, but Pixar has a special
          place in my heart. I have always been into every Pixar movie and loved watching them as a child. As I have grown up, the only thing that has changed, is realizing
        how amazing these really are and the incredible hardwork that is put into making every one of those movies. In high school, I knew that I wanted to go to college
      for something related to art, but I could never figure out what my biggest interest was in the art world. After thinking about it for a long time, I came to the realization
    that animation was the career I wanted to strive for. Since then, I have now been in college for two years, but I am loving this major and know that I made the right decission.</p>
