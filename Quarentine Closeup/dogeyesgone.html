          <p>As you may be able to tell, this picture was taken around April, before the previous picture of her was taken. This was before the rest of her hair started growing more and more,
           and the hair on her face was the first thing to get crazy! As you can see from the caption on the photo, the first thing that happened to her was her eyes were starting to get completely
          covered by her hair! She is always super cute when her hair is short, so it is always funny to see how she looks when her hair grows for a long time!</p>
