        <section style="width:50%;">
          <p>This happened right after quarantine was starting to die down and we came back to school for my third semester. While i was away, my sister and my dad decided
          to get a pet hedgehog! He was named Gibby after a character on a popular show from when I was a kid called iCarly. It was definetly something I was not expecting to happen while I
        was away at school, but it was an amazing surprise!</p>
