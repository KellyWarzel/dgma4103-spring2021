          <p>This was by far one of my favorite moments of quarantine. While we luckily were able to hangout at eachothers house, we still could not go anywhere or hangout with any other people.
          Because of this, Zak had a very smart idea of wanting to get frosted tips! My sister and I did this together in my basement and it was quite the experience! This will also always be
        one of my favorite photos, because you could tell exactly how he was feeling in that moment.</p>
