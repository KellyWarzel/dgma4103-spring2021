          <p>After many months of only eating what was at home, we were finnaly able to go out and eat at a restaraunt! I remember definetly feeling very weird being in a public area again, but
          finnaly eating food that was not made by my mom was super nice! (Also, if you noticed, this was taken after I dyed Zak's hair!)</p>
