          <p>Something that I like to do often is get my nails done. You will often see me with fake nails on because I just love the way they look! While places were closing during quarantine,
           the nail salon was not considered an essential so every place had to close. Because of this, I could not not go months without having my nails done, so I decided to buy my own
          nail kit. As most things go, I started off not being very good at this, but with time i got a lot better! This is a picture of a set I did in August. </p>
